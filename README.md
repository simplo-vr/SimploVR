# What is SimploVR?
Simplo VR is a cheap virtual reality headset with 6-dof, controllers, support for steamvr and much more. Made for the community by the community, simplo is the easiest way to enter in the virtual reality worlds without paying a fortune.

We work hard to make SimploVR a incredible and cheap experience that let you explore the virtual reality worlds. We use refined code, hardware emulation, and so much more to make the experience incredible, keep the price low or even lower the price.

> NOTE: SimploVR is under active development, most of the listed features are still experimental and subject to change.

# Features
SimploVR was made to be a incredible and cheap way to vr. We develop some incredible things that makes the experience pretty great, like controllers, steamvr support, hand tracking (experimental), 6-dof, and much more.

# Our Software

SimploVR and it's hardware, models, pcb's, etc are complety open-source, But our software is not. SimploVR software is what makes SimploVR great as it is. and we managed to get the max potential from the cheap hardware we bought. For now SimploVR software is gonna stay "closed-source" cause we don't need to capitalize the whole project or having to care about license things...

We plain to get simplovr really far on the vr industry and make the project the best cheap option for enter virtual reality worlds. Disclosing our software is the best option to keep the people investing and the project alive at the moment. Maybe one day our software became open-source, But for now that's the way we do it :)
