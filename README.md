# What is SimploVR?
Simplo VR is a cheap virtual reality headset with 6-dof, controllers, support for steamvr, and much more. Made for the community by the community, simplo is the easiest way to enter virtual reality worlds without paying a fortune.

We work hard to make SimploVR an incredible and cheap experience that lets you explore the virtual reality worlds. We use refined code, hardware emulation, and so much more to make the experience incredible, keep the price low, or even lower the price.

> NOTE: SimploVR is under active development, most of the listed features are still experimental and subject to change.

# Features
SimploVR was made to be an incredible and cheap way to vr. We are always working hard to develop things that make the experience pretty great. We use the best that the cheap technology we have has to offer.
- 6 degrees of freedom (6-DOF)
- Positional Tracking
- Controllers
- SteamVR Support
- Finger Tracking (index finger and thumb)

# Experimental Features
We also like to play with the technology we develop there are lots of things we want to contribute to the vr industry this is some of they:
- Hand Tracking (using simplo-dock)
- Full Body Tracking (using simplo-dock)

# Our Software

SimploVR and its hardware, models, PCBs, etc are completely open-source, But our software is not. SimploVR software is what makes SimploVR great as it is. and we managed to get the max potential from the cheap hardware we bought. For now, SimploVR software is gonna stay "closed-source" cause we don't need to capitalize on the whole project or have to care about license things...

We plan to get simplovr really far in the vr industry and make the project the best cheap option for entering virtual reality worlds. Disclosing our software is the best option to keep the people investing and the project alive at the moment. Maybe one day our software became open-source, But for now, that's the way we do it :)
